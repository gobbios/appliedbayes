## do we need Bayes for everything?

- ~~yes~~no[^strt]

. . .

- we don't need a chainsaw to cut the birthday cake

. . .

- but there are a lot of trees that need cutting


[^strt]: but it wouldn't hurt

## where do Bayesian models really shine?

- analysis for network data (multimembership models, SRM)
- propagating uncertainty
- measurement error models
- misclassification
- non-linear models
- latent variables
- custom models aka full Bayesian luxury

transfer of food through groups/audiences of varying sizes

  - dyadic relationship strength ('measurement is uncertain')
  - individual propensities to interact ('measurement is uncertain')
  - what predicts audience size and composition
  - what predicts food transfer target given the audience composition

the effect of relationship strength and dominance rank on greetings

  - dyadic relationships ('measurement is uncertain')
  - individual dominance rank ('measurement is uncertain')
  - role of individual features wrt vocal signalling during approaches
  - role of dyadic features wrt vocal signalling during approaches
  - role of dyadic features and signalling wrt outcomes of approaches

## summary 

- Bayesian methods have a lot of intuitive features

- more computationally demanding (most of the time)

- the underlying machinery shares a lot with frequentist methods

- a high degree of flexibility 

- the effort of getting into it is well worth it, I think

. . .

- ~~what can I model?~~ what do I want to model?
